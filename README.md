# Chicago-Road-Crash
The dataset used for this project consist of a decade long (2013-2023) road crashes that happened in Chicago United States of America. 
Excel was used for data cleaning, modelling, analysis and visualization. 
I set out to answer the following questions from the dataset
1. How many crashes occured within the study period ?
2. How many of these crashes resulted in injuries ?
3. What were the financial implications of these crashes ?
4. What were the primary causes of these crashes ?
Next, I extrated the columns necessary to answer and visualize the above questions from the dataset.
The following insights were derived from my analysis of the dataset
1. A total of 794448 crashes took place between 2013 and 2023 in Chicago
2. These crashes resulted in 150117 injuries, 10.5% of which were incapacitating. Almost a thousand (984) of the total injuries was fatal.
3. More than 60% of the total crashes accounted for over $1500 Dollars in damages.
4. The road crashes had little to do with the prevailing weather condition as at the time of crash nor the state of the road.
5. Analysis showed that 78.62% of the crashes occured during clear weather conditions.
6.  Also, more than 640000 representing 80.65% of the crashes occured on defect-free roads.
7.  Furthermore, more than 64% of the crashes occured in daylight. Although another 22% of the crashes occured in darkness but in a well lit road.
Further investigations reveal that most of the crashes were primarily due to human factors such as falling to yield right-of-way, following too closely,
improper overtaking, over speeding, improper backing, improper lane usage, lack of driving skills, improper turning signal.
